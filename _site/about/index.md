I am a `iOS` and `OS X` developer since 2011. 	


I developed a number of apps you might know for even a listed company or small startups. 

  
As a senior student at [USTB(北京科技大学)](http://www.ustb.edu.cn]) learnt iOS development by myself since 2011 , I joined a startup company named Plato Interactive as an iOS developer invested by Xu Xiaoping who is the most famous angel investor in China. I developed the [Mobile Messager 2.0](http://offlined.from.appstore) which is quite a Wechat and Mitalk's competitor back then. Just before the company died, we finished an app named [点滴](http://www.leiphone.com/0425-china-path.html) as a copycat of Path, you can still see my own avatar In the screenshot.

  
My first two App's result is obious, but being beaten by Wechat is not quit a shame. Just before I graduate, I have a short internship at [Renren Inc](http://www.renren.com), but just after I graduate, I formally begin my career at [Sohu Inc](http://www.sohu.com) as a Web software developer (I was intend to develop iOS app but transferred to a web developer because of some internal reasons). 
  
  
During the short days in Financial Department, I participated developing Sohu Virtue Stock Market called [寻牛汇](http://q.stock.sohu.com/cgds/), which is till running perfectly with my nusty Java code. Meanwhile, I helped my friends developed a video aggregation App named [片片](https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/pian-pian-bai-wan-gao-qing/id554416902?mt=8) and its [iPad version](https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/pian-pian-bai-wan-gao-qing/id645246009?mt=8), it have about 1 million users till now, but we have to give up because of the video copyright issue.
    
    
In early 2013, I joint a Sohu internal startup team and developed [蓝莓](http://lanmei.fm/).

  

In middle 2013, I joint with my former leader of Plato Interactive  as a co-founder. Since then we developed [某某](http://moumou.im), a best App for you finding friends of your friends and [闪闪](http://shanshan.im), a image only communicating tool which is awesome for intimate friends. You probably have heard about these products because some of the [media reports](http://www.36kr.com/p/205503.html), like [this](http://www.faxianapp.cn/20585.html), [this](http://tech.qq.com/a/20130820/016082.htm) or [this](http://www.baike.com/wiki/%E6%9F%90%E6%9F%90).
  
   
I am recently interested in OS X development and have a personal project on sale on Mac App Store called [Potato Wallpaper](https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/potato-wallpaper/id893242839?mt=12). Feel free to purchase one for me, hahaha :).
